				<h4> BrainTap </h4>
				<br>
				<p> Have you ever wanted to control your laptop or computer with your mind? Well, using a <a href="http://www.thinkmelon.com/">Melon EEG headband</a>, my team and I were able to do precisely that. We mapped brainwaves obtained from the Melon EEG headband, and voice data obtained from a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/kinect">Microsoft Kinect</a>, to create a <b>voice and brain controlled laptop</b>. We mapped different brainwaves to different keys on the keyboard, and certain words to defined macros, so that we could do a host of things without ever touching our laptop. More information can be found on our project page <a href= "https://devpost.com/software/braintap">here</a>.

				<h4> Home.ly </h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					Sometimes getting up to turn off the light when you're comfortable can be a pain. Keeping this in mind, my team and I set out to create a method by which we could control systems in our house without ever getting up. We combined <a href="https://www.myo.com/">Myo armbands</a> with <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/">Samsung Smart Things</a> to create a <b>gesture controlled home</b>. Using this you could control individual lightbulbs, locks, lights, speakers, etc. However, we still thought this wasn't lazy enough, so we decided to make 'modes'. Some modes included 'party' mode, which set the lights and sound system for a party, and 'lockdown' mode which locked your doors and switched off non-essential lights. More information can be found on our project page <a href="https://devpost.com/software/home-ly">here</a>.

				<h4> SmartSecurity </h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					I take security very seriously, and sometimes a simple, yet effective security system is a necessity. So we set out to make a simple security system in 24 hours. Using a simple Node.js HTTP server, and javascript wrapper for a raspberry pi, we were able to create a <b>two factor authentication security system</b>, using a fingerprint as well as a visual indicator to open a lock.
					As a later addition, we tried to add in a <a href="https://www.myo.com/">Myo armband</a>, but thought that would be making it too complex.

			<h4> A Simple Shell </h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				Made as part of my 	Operating Systems class, the simple shell had marginally better performance than the native BASH shell. Implemented fully in C, with multithreading and <b>multiprocess handling capabilities</b>, this was my first introduction to low-level programming.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project">
			<h4> HTTP and TCP servers</h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				As a part of my Networks class, I implemented HTTP as well as TCP servers and clients. The HTTP servers were configured to handle multiple clients and had standard behavior. The TCP server used <b>RENO congestion control</b>, and could handle multiple connections as well. This was my first introduction to socket-level programming and network programming.
